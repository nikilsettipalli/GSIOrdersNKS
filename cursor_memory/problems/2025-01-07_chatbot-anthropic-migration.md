# Problem: Chatbot API Migration to Anthropic Claude

## Problem
- User requested migration from OpenAI to Anthropic Claude API
- Existing chatbot API was using OpenAI with streaming responses
- Tests were failing due to TypeScript errors and incorrect mocking
- Need to maintain both streaming and non-streaming response capabilities

## Solution
1. **Updated API Implementation** (`pages/api/chatbot.ts`):
   - Replaced OpenAI client with direct fetch calls to Anthropic API
   - Updated model to `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`
   - Fixed header format from `Authorization: Bearer` to `x-api-key`
   - Added proper TypeScript types for Anthropic responses
   - Maintained streaming and non-streaming response support

2. **Fixed Test Suite** (`__tests__/api/chatbot.spec.ts`):
   - Updated mocks to use Anthropic API format
   - Added TextEncoder/TextDecoder polyfills for Node.js
   - Fixed streaming test mocks and response handling
   - All 16 tests now pass successfully

3. **Type Safety Improvements**:
   - Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
   - Fixed ReadableStream type issues
   - Added proper error handling types

4. **Manual Testing**:
   - Created Postman collection at `testing/manual-chatbot.postman_collection.json`
   - Includes test cases for basic questions, streaming, and error handling

## Files Changed
- `pages/api/chatbot.ts` - API implementation
- `__tests__/api/chatbot.spec.ts` - Test suite
- `testing/manual-chatbot.postman_collection.json` - Manual testing

## Environment Requirements
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable must be set
- API key format: `sk-ant-api03-...`

## Testing Results
- ✅ All unit tests pass (16/16)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Manual testing collection available
- ✅ Streaming and non-streaming responses work
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive
